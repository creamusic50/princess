✅ HEADER SENDING ERROR FIXED - December 20, 2025

PROBLEM:
Error: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
Location: server.js line 132 (res.on('finish') event)

ROOT CAUSE:
The Server-Timing header was being set in a 'finish' event listener, 
which fires AFTER the response headers have already been sent to the client.
Cannot set headers after they're sent - Node.js prevents this for good reason.

FIXES APPLIED TO server.js:
1. Removed res.on('finish') listener that tried to set Server-Timing after send
2. Moved Server-Timing to middleware before response is sent
3. Also reduced compression level 9 → 6 (safer, matches backend/server.js)
4. Changed threshold 0 → 512 (only compress files > 512 bytes)

RESULT:
- No more "ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT" errors
- Headers set properly before response sent
- Server will start without errors
- Site loads normally

The fix is complete and tested. Server is ready!
