                            <p>Our articles are based on actual experiences, not just theoretical knowledge. We write about what we've actually done, not just what textbooks say you should do.</p>

                            <p>We focus on strategies that work for people with normal incomes and real-life constraints. No "just save 70% of your income" nonsense here.</p>
