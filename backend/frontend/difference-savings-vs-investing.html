 <h1>Difference Between Savings and Investing</h1>
 <p>Savings and investing both help you reach financial goals, but they serve different purposes. Savings is about preserving money for short-term needs, while investing is about growing wealth over time.</p>

 <h2>What is savings?</h2>
 <p>Savings typically means holding cash or cash-equivalent accounts such as savings accounts or money-market funds. Savings is ideal for emergency funds, short-term goals, and predictable expenses.</p>

 <h2>What is investing?</h2>
 <p>Investing involves buying assets like stocks, bonds, or funds with the expectation of earning a return over time. Investing carries risk but offers higher potential returns for long-term goals.</p>

 <h2>Key differences</h2>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Time horizon:</strong> Savings = short-term; Investing = long-term.</li>
 <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Savings = low risk; Investing = variable risk.</li>
 <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Savings = highly liquid; Investing = may be less liquid.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>How to balance both</h2>
 <p>Keep 3–6 months of expenses in an emergency savings fund. For retirement and wealth building, allocate a portion of income to diversified investments, increasing contributions over time.</p>

 <h2>Practical steps</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>Build an emergency fund in a savings account.</li>
 <li>Pay down high-interest debt.</li>
 <li>Start investing regularly in low-cost index funds or retirement accounts.</li>
 </ol>

 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>Use savings for short-term stability and investing for long-term growth. Both are essential components of a solid financial plan.</p>
