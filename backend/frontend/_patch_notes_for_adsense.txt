Patch applied: added preconnect/resource hints and deferred non-critical scripts in several frontend pages.
Files modified:
- frontend/index.html
- frontend/post.html
- frontend/create-post.html
- frontend/admin-fixed-complete.html
- frontend/contact.html
- frontend/authors.html
- frontend/profile-settings.html

Notes:
- Added rel=preconnect for fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com, and AdSense domains.
- Added dns-prefetch for AdSense domains.
- Added defer attribute to non-critical scripts (cookie-consent, contact, main, config when safe, tinyMCE CDN scripts).
- Removed back-link to admin dashboard in profile-settings.html to avoid public link exposure.
