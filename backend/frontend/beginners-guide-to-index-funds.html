 <h1>Beginner's Guide to Index Funds</h1>
 <p>Index funds are an efficient, low-cost way to invest in a broad market slice. For most long-term investors, index funds offer diversification, low fees, and simplicity. This guide explains what index funds are and how to get started.</p>

 <h2>What is an index fund?</h2>
 <p>An index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that tracks a market index (e.g., S&P 500). Instead of trying to beat the market by picking stocks, index funds aim to match market returns at a low cost.</p>

 <h2>Why index funds are popular</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Low fees: No expensive active management.</li>
 <li>Diversification: Spreads risk across many companies.</li>
 <li>Simplicity: Easy to buy and maintain a long-term strategy.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>How to pick an index fund</h2>
 <p>Look for low expense ratio, broad diversification, and tax efficiency. ETFs often have lower expense ratios and trade like stocks, while mutual funds can be convenient for recurring investments.</p>

 <h2>Starting with index funds</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>Open an investment account (brokerage or retirement account).</li>
 <li>Decide asset allocation based on time horizon and risk tolerance.</li>
 <li>Choose funds that cover US equities, international equities, and bonds as needed.</li>
 <li>Automate regular contributions and rebalance annually.</li>
 </ol>

 <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Chasing performance: Past winners don't guarantee future returns.</li>
 <li>Overtrading: Frequent buying/selling increases costs and harms returns.</li>
 <li>Ignoring fees: Small differences in expense ratios compound over decades.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
 <p>Index funds are a powerful tool for most investors. With low costs, broad diversification, and a straightforward strategy, they help you stay invested and focused on long-term goals.</p>
