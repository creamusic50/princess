 <h1>How to Plan for Retirement in Your 20s, 30s, 40s</h1>
 <p>Retirement planning should start as early as possible, but it’s never too late to make meaningful progress. Here are practical steps for different life stages.</p>

 <h2>If you are in your 20s</h2>
 <p>Focus on establishing good habits: build an emergency fund, contribute to employer retirement plans, and start investing regularly even with small amounts. Time is your biggest advantage because compound returns multiply over decades.</p>

 <h2>If you are in your 30s</h2>
 <p>Increase retirement contributions as income grows, prioritize saving for major life goals (house, children), and maintain a diversified investment portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance.</p>

 <h2>If you are in your 40s</h2>
 <p>Catch-up contributions become important if retirement savings are behind. Maximize tax-advantaged accounts, consider paying down high-interest debt, and review retirement income projections annually.</p>

 <h2>Universal retirement tips</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Start or increase contributions to retirement accounts (401(k), IRA).</li>
 <li>Use low-cost index funds for long-term growth.</li>
 <li>Rebalance portfolio periodically and reduce risk as retirement nears.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Practical action plan</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>Automate a percentage of your paycheck to retirement accounts.</li>
 <li>Use employer match fully — it’s free money.</li>
 <li>Run simple projections to estimate required savings rate.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>Planning for retirement is a marathon, not a sprint. Small, consistent contributions and a simple, diversified strategy outperform frequent attempts to time the market.</p>
