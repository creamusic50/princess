✅ COMPRESSION ERROR FIXED - December 20, 2025

PROBLEM:
Site went blank with error: net::ERR_CONTENT_DECODING_FAILED
Root cause: Aggressive compression (level 9, threshold 0) + manual Content-Encoding header caused browser decoding issues

FIXES APPLIED TO backend/server.js:
1. Changed compression level from 9 → 6 (safe balance)
2. Changed threshold from 0 → 512 (only compress files > 512 bytes)
3. Removed manual Content-Encoding header that was breaking decompression

RESULT:
- Compression still active for performance
- No more decoding errors
- Files will load properly
- Site should be fully functional now

DEPLOYMENT:
The fix is ready in backend/server.js and will deploy automatically to tilana.online
