      <h1>Smart Use of Credit Cards Without Getting Trapped</h1>
      <p>Credit cards can be powerful financial tools when used responsibly. They help build credit history, offer consumer protections, and provide rewards. However, high interest rates and fees can quickly undo the benefits. This guide explains practical rules to use credit cards safely and get the most value.</p>

      <h2>Rule 1 — Pay your statement in full each month</h2>
      <p>The single best habit is paying the full statement balance on time. Interest on revolving balances compounds fast. Paying in full avoids finance charges and preserves the benefit of rewards.</p>

      <h2>Rule 2 — Use cards for planned purchases, not impulse buys</h2>
      <p>Put predictable, budgeted purchases on your card—bills, groceries, and recurring subscriptions—so you can pay them off immediately. Avoid using cards for unplanned discretionary spending unless you have the cash to cover it.</p>

      <h2>Rule 3 — Keep utilization low</h2>
      <p>Credit utilization (balance divided by credit limit) is a major factor in credit scoring. Aim to keep utilization under 30%, and ideally under 10% for the best scores.</p>

      <h2>Rule 4 — Choose the right card</h2>
      <p>Pick cards that match spending habits: cashback for general spending, travel rewards for frequent travelers, or low-rate cards if you sometimes carry a balance. Pay attention to annual fees vs expected benefits.</p>

      <h2>Rule 5 — Watch fees and interest</h2>
      <p>Avoid late fees by setting up autopay for at least the minimum. If you carry a balance occasionally, consider a low-interest card or a 0% intro APR offer for balance transfers—but read terms carefully and plan to pay before the promotional period ends.</p>

      <h2>Rule 6 — Use benefits strategically</h2>
      <p>Many cards offer purchase protection, extended warranties, travel insurance, and rental car coverage. Understand these perks and use them when relevant to get additional value from your cards.</p>

      <h2>Rule 7 — Protect your account</h2>
      <p>Enable alerts and two-factor authentication where available. Monitor statements regularly and report unauthorized charges immediately. Use virtual card numbers for one-off online purchases if your issuer offers them.</p>

      <h2>How to recover from mistakes</h2>
      <p>If you miss a payment, contact your issuer quickly—sometimes fees can be waived. Create a repayment plan that prioritizes high-interest balances, and stop using cards for new credit until the situation stabilizes.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>When you follow basic rules—pay in full, keep utilization low, and choose cards that match your spending—you can use credit cards to your advantage without getting trapped by debt. Think of cards as a tool, not free money.</p>
