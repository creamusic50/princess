 <h1>How to Create a Personal Budget That Works (Step-by-Step)</h1>
 <p>Having a budget doesn't mean you can't enjoy life — it means you plan to spend on what matters while saving for the future. This guide walks through a simple, repeatable budgeting method you can implement today.</p>

 <h2>Step 1 — Track your income and expenses for 30 days</h2>
 <p>Before you make a plan, know where your money goes. Track every expense for a month: subscriptions, groceries, transport, dining out, and debt payments. Use a spreadsheet, a budgeting app, or a simple notebook.</p>

 <h2>Step 2 — Categorize expenses</h2>
 <p>Group spending into categories: Housing, Utilities, Food, Transportation, Insurance, Debt, Savings, Entertainment, and Misc. This helps identify where you can reduce spending.</p>

 <h2>Step 3 — Set realistic goals</h2>
 <p>Decide short-term (emergency fund, paying down credit card) and long-term goals (retirement, house down payment). Assign a dollar amount and timeline to each goal.</p>

 <h2>Step 4 — Choose a budgeting method</h2>
 <p>Popular methods include the 50/30/20 rule (50% needs / 30% wants / 20% savings), zero-based budgeting, and envelope budgeting. Pick one that fits your personality and income stability.</p>

 <h2>Step 5 — Build your monthly plan</h2>
 <p>Using your tracked numbers, assign every dollar a purpose. Prioritize essentials, set automatic transfers to savings, and create a small buffer for variable costs.</p>

 <h2>Step 6 — Reduce expenses strategically</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Cancel unused subscriptions.</li>
 <li>Shop for better insurance rates.</li>
 <li>Meal plan to cut dining out expenses.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Step 7 — Automate saving and bill payments</h2>
 <p>Automation reduces the chance you'll miss payments and helps grow savings without thinking about it.</p>

 <h2>Step 8 — Review monthly and adjust</h2>
 <p>Set a calendar reminder to review your budget each month. Adjust categories, update goals, and celebrate progress.</p>

 <h2>Example budget template</h2>
 <p>Net income: $3,500</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Housing: $1,000</li>
 <li>Utilities: $150</li>
 <li>Food: $400</li>
 <li>Transport: $200</li>
 <li>Debt: $300</li>
 <li>Savings: $700</li>
 <li>Entertainment: $150</li>
 <li>Misc: $100</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Final tips</h2>
 <p>Be patient. Budgets adapt over time. Track progress, not perfection. Use this method consistently and your financial resilience will grow.</p>
