 <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
 <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 26, 2025</p>

 <div class="legal-content">
 <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
 <p>At Smart Money Guide, we believe in being completely transparent with our readers about how we generate revenue. This page explains our affiliate relationships and how we approach product recommendations.</p>

 <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
 <p>An affiliate link is a special tracking link that allows us to earn a commission when you purchase a product or service through our recommendation. This means that if you click on certain links in our articles and make a purchase, we may receive a small percentage of the sale at no additional cost to you.</p>

 <h3>How It Works</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>You click on an affiliate link in one of our articles</li>
 <li>You're redirected to the merchant's website</li>
 <li>If you make a purchase, the merchant pays us a commission</li>
 <li>The price you pay remains exactly the same</li>
 <li>Your purchase helps support our website operations</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Our Affiliate Relationships</h2>
 <p>Smart Money Guide participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which may include but are not limited to:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Amazon Associates Program:</strong> We earn from qualifying purchases made through Amazon links</li>
 <li><strong>Financial Service Affiliates:</strong> Credit card companies, banks, investment platforms, and other financial institutions</li>
 <li><strong>Software and Tools:</strong> Budgeting apps, financial tracking tools, and educational platforms</li>
 <li><strong>Advertising Networks:</strong> Google AdSense and other display advertising programs</li>
 <li><strong>Merchant Affiliate Programs:</strong> Direct affiliate relationships with brands and companies</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Our Editorial Independence</h2>
 <p><strong>Here's what's most important:</strong> Our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content or recommendations. We maintain strict editorial independence and only recommend products and services we genuinely believe offer value to our readers.</p>

 <h3>Our Promise to You</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> We share both pros and cons of products, even if they're affiliate partners</li>
 <li><strong>No Paid Placements:</strong> Companies cannot pay us to recommend their products</li>
 <li><strong>Real Experience:</strong> We only recommend products we've personally used or thoroughly researched</li>
 <li><strong>Best Interests:</strong> Our primary goal is to provide value to you, not maximize commissions</li>
 <li><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> We clearly identify affiliate content when it appears</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>When We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
 <p>Affiliate links may appear in the following places on our website:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Within blog posts and articles</li>
 <li>In product reviews and comparisons</li>
 <li>On resource and tools pages</li>
 <li>In recommendation lists and buying guides</li>
 <li>Occasionally in email newsletters</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>How We Identify Affiliate Content</h3>
 <p>We strive to clearly identify affiliate content through:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Disclosure statements at the beginning of articles containing affiliate links</li>
 <li>Visual indicators or labels on affiliate links</li>
 <li>Clear language indicating when content contains affiliate relationships</li>
 <li>This dedicated disclosure page accessible from our footer</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Product Recommendations</h2>
 <p>When we recommend products or services, we consider multiple factors:</p>

 <h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Quality and Value:</strong> Does it provide genuine value to our audience?</li>
 <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Is it appropriate for our readers' needs?</li>
 <li><strong>Reputation:</strong> Does the company have a track record of customer satisfaction?</li>
 <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Is it reasonably priced for what it offers?</li>
 <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Have we or others had positive experiences with it?</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>What We Don't Recommend</h3>
 <p>We will never recommend:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Products or services we haven't researched thoroughly</li>
 <li>Scams or questionable business practices</li>
 <li>Products solely because they offer high commissions</li>
 <li>Anything we wouldn't use ourselves or recommend to family</li>
 <li>Products that contradict our values or editorial standards</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Advertising Revenue</h2>
 <p>In addition to affiliate commissions, we may generate revenue from:</p>

 <h3>Display Advertising</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> Contextual ads displayed on our pages</li>
 <li><strong>Banner Ads:</strong> Direct advertising partnerships</li>
 <li><strong>Native Advertising:</strong> Sponsored content clearly labeled as such</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Sponsored Content</h3>
 <p>Occasionally, we may publish sponsored content from brands or companies. When we do:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>It will be clearly labeled as "Sponsored," "Paid Partnership," or "Advertisement"</li>
 <li>We maintain editorial control over the content</li>
 <li>We only accept sponsorships from brands that align with our values</li>
 <li>We never compromise our editorial integrity for sponsorships</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Your Trust Matters Most</h2>
 <p>We understand that our relationship with you is built on trust. That trust is more valuable to us than any commission or advertising revenue. While affiliate income helps us maintain and improve this website, we will never sacrifice our integrity or your trust to earn more money.</p>

 <h3>If You Have Concerns</h3>
 <p>If you ever feel that we've recommended something that didn't live up to our promises, or if you have concerns about our affiliate practices, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>. We take feedback seriously and continuously strive to improve.</p>

 <h2>How Affiliate Income Supports Our Work</h2>
