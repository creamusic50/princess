                    <h2>Counter-Notification</h2>
                    <p>If you believe that material you posted was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us by providing the following information to our Copyright Agent:</p>

                    <h3>Required Information for Counter-Notice</h3>

                    <h3>Counter-Notice Procedure</h3>
                    <p>Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to the person who filed the original DMCA notice. If we do not receive notice within 10-14 business days that the original complainant is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material, we may restore the removed material or cease disabling access to it.</p>

                    <h2>Repeat Infringer Policy</h2>
                    <p>In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, users or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also, at our sole discretion, limit access to our website and terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

                    <h2>False Claims</h2>
                    <p>Please be aware that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees. If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is infringing, please contact an attorney before filing a notice with us.</p>

                    <h2>Our Commitment to Original Content</h2>
                    <p>Smart Money Guide is committed to producing original, high-quality content. We respect copyright laws and take the following measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All articles are written by our team or properly licensed contributors</li>
                        <li>We properly attribute and link to sources when referencing third-party information</li>
                        <li>Images are either original, properly licensed, or from royalty-free sources</li>
                        <li>We use proper citations for quotes and excerpts</li>
                        <li>We respect fair use guidelines when referencing copyrighted material</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Fair Use</h2>
                    <p>Smart Money Guide may use copyrighted material that we believe constitutes "fair use" under Section 107 of the Copyright Act. Fair use is a legal doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders for purposes such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Commentary and criticism</li>
                        <li>News reporting</li>
                        <li>Research and scholarship</li>
                        <li>Teaching</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We evaluate fair use on a case-by-case basis considering factors such as the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the potential market.</p>

                    <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
                    <p>While Smart Money Guide primarily publishes content created by our team, if we implement user comments or contributions in the future, users will be responsible for ensuring they have the right to post any content they submit. By submitting content, users represent that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They own the copyright to the material or have permission to use it</li>
                        <li>The material does not infringe any third-party rights</li>
                        <li>They grant us a license to use, display, and distribute the content</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Third-Party Websites and Links</h2>
                    <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content, copyright compliance, or practices of these external sites. If you believe a linked website contains infringing material, please contact the website owner directly.</p>

                    <h2>International Copyright</h2>
                    <p>While the DMCA is a U.S. law, Smart Money Guide respects international copyright laws. If you are located outside the United States and believe your copyright has been infringed, you may still file a notice with us using the procedure outlined above.</p>

                    <h2>Processing Time</h2>
                    <p>We take all DMCA notices seriously and will review them promptly. Typically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Initial Review:</strong> Within 24-48 hours of receipt</li>
                        <li><strong>Action Taken:</strong> Within 72 hours if the notice meets all requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Response to Counter-Notice:</strong> Within 10-14 business days</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Content Removal Process</h2>
                    <p>If we determine that material is infringing, we will:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Remove or disable access to the material expeditiously</li>
                        <li>Notify the person who posted the material (if applicable)</li>
                        <li>Provide information about the counter-notification process</li>
                        <li>Document the removal for our records</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Trademark Policy</h2>
                    <p>In addition to copyright, we respect trademark rights. If you believe Smart Money Guide is using your trademark in a way that causes confusion about the source or endorsement of goods or services, please contact us using the information provided above.</p>

                    <h2>Modifications to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this DMCA Copyright Policy from time to time to reflect changes in law or our practices. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page when changes are made. Continued use of our website after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
